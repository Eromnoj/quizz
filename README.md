# Easy Quizzy

This little project is the first I realised by myself using the React Librairy

The project was a recommendation from the Scrimba course by Bob Ziroll on React. I took some liberties concerning the design and the API.

It is deployed with Netlify, you can have a look at it following [this link](https://62c841ca90d243286f627951--mellow-elf-32f56d.netlify.app/)
